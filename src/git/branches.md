# Branches

## CREATING

### Create a branch

```shell
git branch <branch-name>
```

### Create a branch and switch to it

common

```shell
git checkout -b <branch-name> 
```

new

```shell
git switch -c <branch-name>
```

### If there is a remote branch, but you need to create a local one and link to the remote one (if there is already a local one with the same name, then it will link to the remote one)

```shell
git branch --track <local-branch> origin/<remote-branch>
```

```shell
git branch -f <local-branch> origin/<remote-branch>
```

### If there is a local branch and you need to create a remote one with tracking

```shell
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

## MOVING

### Move branch pointer to a different commit (*destination-commit* can be a branch name)

```shell
git reset --hard <destination-commit>
```

```shell
git branch â€“f <branch-name> <destination-commit>
```

## DELETING

### DELETE remote branch (*remote-name* usually *origin*)

```shell
git push -d <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

\
Don't forget to do a `git fetch --all --prune` or `git fetch --all -p` on other machines after deleting the remote branch on the server.
After deleting the local branch with `git branch -d` and deleting the remote branch with `git push -d origin` other machines may still have "obsolete tracking branches" (to see them do `git branch -a`). To get rid of these do `git fetch --all --prune`

### DELETE local branch

```shell
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

The *-D* option is an alias for *--delete* *--force*, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status"

```shell
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

### DELETE local remote-tracking branch

```shell
git branch -dr <remote>/<branch>
```

longer

```shell
git branch --delete --remotes <remote>/<branch>
```
